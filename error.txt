types of error
    1. syntax error
        when we divert from the main code
        eg print("acb)
            3 +
            def/0

    2. indentation error
    line aligned when using : in func , loop use tab in next line
        when the code is not proper aligned
        eg  for x in range(1,n):
            print(x)

    3. type error
      operation must be done on same data types
      when we take input the input is in the format of string so we have to convert it into string to avoid this error
      eg 4+"2"
        "as"/0


    4. name error
      also known as variable not defined error
      eg x=3
        z=a+x
        a is not defined
        abc/0

    5. zero division error
      when we try to divide the number by zero
      eg 4/0

    6. index error
      to access the index not available in string or list
      eg x="happy"
        x[10]
        x=[1,2,3,4,5]
        x[6]

    7. runtime error
      error occur while running the code
      cause is not known

    8. attribute error
      using wrong method for different datatype
      eg x=23
        x.upper()
